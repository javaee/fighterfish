/**
 * This test sample demonstrates use of pax-exam provided {@link JUnit4TestRunner} JUnit test runner. This test class
 * name is suffixed with IT to automatically include it in the test list by maven failsafe plugin.
 *
 * This custom runner from PAX-EXAM has the ability to provision an OSGi runtime either in the current JVM or
 * in a remote JVM with a list of bundles configured by the test. The custom runner calls a method
 * in the test class annotated with {@link Configuration} and uses its return value to configure the environment.
 * In our test case, {@link #getPaxExamConfiguration()} is that method.
 *
 * This test case also demonstrates use {@link TestContext} to deploy various artifacts like OSGi bundles,
 * Java EE applications, JDBC/JMS resources. See {@link #test}.
