/**
 * This class is responsible for publishing events using EventAdmin service for a WAB deployment lifecycle.
 * During deployment, various events are raised as described below (taken verbatim from spec):
 * The Web Extender must track all WABs in the OSGi service platform in which the Web Extender is
 * installed. The Web Extender must post Event Admin events, which is asynchronous, at crucial points
 * in its processing. The topic of the event must be one of the following values:
 * •   org/osgi/service/web/DEPLOYING – The Web Extender has accepted a WAB and started the
 * process of deploying a Web Application.
 * •   org/osgi/service/web/DEPLOYED – The Web Extender has finished deploying a Web Application, and
 * the Web Application is now available for web requests on its Context Path.
 * •   org/osgi/service/web/UNDEPLOYING – The web extender started undeploying the Web Application
 * in response to its corresponding WAB being stopped or the Web Extender is stopped.
 * •   org/osgi/service/web/UNDEPLOYED – The Web Extender has undeployed the Web Application.
 * The application is no longer available for web requests.
 * •   org/osgi/service/web/FAILED – The Web Extender has failed to deploy the Web Application, this
 * event can be fired after the DEPLOYING event has fired and indicates that no DEPLOYED event will be fired.
 * <p/>
 * For each event topic above, the following properties must be published:
 * •   bundle.symbolicName – (String) The bundle symbolic name of the WAB.
 * •   bundle.id – (Long) The bundle id of the WAB.
 * •   bundle – (Bundle) The Bundle object of the WAB.
 * •   bundle.version – (Version) The version of the WAB.
 * •   context.path – (String) The Context Path of the Web Application.
 * •   timestamp – (Long) The time when the event occurred
 * •   extender.bundle – (Bundle) The Bundle object of the Web Extender Bundle
 * •   extender.bundle.id – (Long) The id of the Web Extender Bundle.
 * •   extender.bundle.symbolicName – (String) The symbolic name of the Web Extender Bundle.
 * •   extender.bundle.version – (Version) The version of the Web Extender Bundle.
 * <p/>
 * In addition, the org/osgi/service/web/FAILED event must also have the following property:
 * •   exception – (Throwable) If an exception caused the failure, an exception detailing the error that
 * occurred during the deployment of the WAB.
 * •   collision – (String) If a name collision occurred, the Web-ContextPath that had a collision
 * •   collision.bundles – (Long) If a name collision occurred, a list of bundle ids that all have the same
 * value for the Web-ContextPath manifest header.
