# This is a simple script that we use to run OSGi Compliance Tests.
# We use the same file for all test suites, viz: 
# org.osgi.test.cases.http, 
# org.osgi.test.cases.transaction, 
# org.osgi.test.cases.webcontainer, 
# org.osgi.test.cases.jdbc, 
# etc.
#
# This script uses following properties which are supplied to it from command line:
#
# gfhome -  specifies where glassfish has been installed.
# cthome - specifies where OSGi CT has been checked out
# ctname - refers to the OSGi CT test suite that we want to run. e.g., http|transaction|webcontainer
# testclass - refers to the individual JUnit test class that you may want to execute. i
# When this is not specified, all tests are executed
